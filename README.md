# LedLightMachine

A small library for the ESP32 with some little LED effects.

- Blink
- Fade
- SimpleCandle
- AdvancedCandle

The library was written to control the lights of a brick build advent wreath (Lego © 40426)

The candle effect is "good enough", but can be much improved.

Unfortunately i had no time to write a documentation 🙁, but the source code should be clean enough, to update or extend it.
